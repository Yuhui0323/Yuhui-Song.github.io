title: "Evolution of corrosion prediction models for oil and gas pipelines: From empirical-driven to data-driven"
collection: Engineering Failure Analysis
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This work systematically reviews these models including their evolution, characteristics, limitations, and performance, and highlights the application of data-driven models. In addition, a ML method database of corrosion prediction for oil and gas pipelines was created by summarizing the pre-processing, input and output parameters and performance metrics of ML models, which provide guidance for rational selection of models. Finally, conclusions and recommendations are presented and provide a broad outlook for future research paths.'
